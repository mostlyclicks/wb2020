        <p>The PV Solar System that Wieser Brothers General Contractor, Inc. installed in July 2013 provides for local power generation.  The 156 panel, 39 kW array, will generate up to 75% of Wieser Brothersâ€™ building electric needs.  This generation comes from a clean energy source allowing for fossil fuel reduction, equivalent to 29 acres of forest each year.  For the community, this means cleaner air, water and decreased CO2 emissions.  All around, solar is a good building practice leading to long-term sustainable business.  Wieser Brothers works with many customers who are following green and sustainable building practices.</p>
