        <p>Raised on the family dairy farm with sixteen brothers and sisters, Brian and Jeff learned about hard work and honesty at a very young age. They began their construction career as apprentice carpenters with a local commercial contractor. Learning the trade through hands-on experience, they became journeyman carpenters and quickly progressed to job superintendents running multi-million dollar projects.</p>

        <p>Captured by entrepreneurial spirit, Brian and Jeff formed Wieser Brothers General Contractor, Inc. in 1994 with the desire to provide quality construction services at competitive prices. Since inception, the company has grown from 2 employees to over 130. </p>

        <p>Hands-on management has been crucial to the company’s success. Brian oversees field operations. He visits the job sites on a regular basis guaranteeing quality control and safe operations. Jeff manages sales and support staff. He is directly involved in the bidding process and oversees construction projects until they are complete.</p>
